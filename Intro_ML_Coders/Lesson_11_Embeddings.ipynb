    "    * Optimizing multylayer SGD\n",
    "        * Data * f(x) - Softmax, Sigmoid\n",
    "        * Put it through some loss Cross Enthropy\n",
    "        * Calculate Derivative wrt weights - chain rule\n",
    "        * Cross-enthropy - like RMSE, but for classification = Actual*LOG(prediction) - (1 - Actual) * log(1 - prediction)\n",
    "        * if(y = 1) -> log(y) else log(y)\n",
    "        * RMSE/CE - Statistical Idea of Best Linear unbiased estimator\n",
    "        * Using Absolute Deviation > RMSE -> often works better\n",
    "        * Impacted differently by regularization\n",
    "        * l = x.e(xw, y) + aw^2\n",
    "2. Embeddings:\n",
    "   * Matrix Multply Feature vs Coeff.\n",
    "   * Simple array lookup.\n",
    "   * Can be used for sale of items.\n",
    "   * Entity-Embeddings."
