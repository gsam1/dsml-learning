# dsml-learning
Repository for Data Science / Machine Learning (DSML) 'Learning'

## Motivation 
Since [the other repo](https://github.com/gsam1/dsml-projects) is focused on project I did, I decided I need a place to store my learning work. 

The repo will be mostly in Python (jupyter notebooks). 

## Topics, Courses and Materials
The list of books/courses/topics in the repo, along with a short explanation what I intend to store there:
1. [Book] [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - Solve the exercises for each chapter in Python.
2. [Course] [Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/ml.html) - Notes and bits of code.
3. [Book] [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) - Solve the exercises for each chapter.
4. [Course] [Deep Learning Ai]() - The notebooks from the chapters that presented an interest.
5. [Course] [Spark Data Analytics]() - Various notebooks and exercises from the course
6. [Course] [Spark Python Hands On]() - Various notebooks with the code-alongs..
Any other topic related to the subject will be added here.
